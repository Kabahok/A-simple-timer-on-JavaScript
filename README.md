# `A simple timer on JavaScript`

### Let's start with the basic settings:
We creat a variable, in which the arrow function was placed and 2 arguments were passed

```JavaScript
  const timer = (id, deadline) => {}
```

We immediately import the function to use it in the assembly (if you are working with a modular structure)

```JavaScript
  import default timer;
```
